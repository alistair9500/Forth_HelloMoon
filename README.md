# Forth_HelloMoon
 
Sick of the usual **Hello World** app and looking for something a little more detailed?

Then here it is - **Hello Moon** - A variant of the Lunar Lander program that I remember from my HP 25C calculator.

Code was found here: https://www.hpcalc.org/details/7790

I am using gForth - see https://gforth.org/
and a windows installer found here - https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/
